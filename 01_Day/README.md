# DAY 1: VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES

<h4>Activity 1: Variable Declaration</h4>

Task 1: Declare a variable using war, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.

Task 2: Declare a variable using let, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

<h4>Activity 2: Constant Declaration</h4>

Task 3: Declare a variable using const, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

<h4>Activity 3: Data Types</h4>

Task 4: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator.

<h4>Activity 4: Reassigning Variables</h4>

Task 5: Declare a variable using let, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

<h4>Activity 5: Understanding const</h4>

Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error.

<h2>Feature Request:</h2>

1. Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

2. Reassignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment.

<h2>Achievement:</h2>

By the end of these activities, you will:

Know how to declare variables using var, let, and const.

Understand the different data types in JavaScript.

Be able to use the typeof operator to identify the data type of a variable.

Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of const variables.
