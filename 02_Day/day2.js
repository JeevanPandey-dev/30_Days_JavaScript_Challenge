// Activity 1 : Arithmetic Operations

// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

(() => {
    const addNum =  (num1,num2) => num1 + num2;
    let sumOfNum = addNum(5,6)
    console.log(sumOfNum);
})();

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

(() => {
    const subtractNum =  (num1,num2) => num1 - num2;
    let differenceOfNum = subtractNum(5,6)
    console.log(differenceOfNum);
})();

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

(() => {
    const multiplyNum =  (num1,num2) => num1 * num2;
    let productOfNum = multiplyNum(5,6)
    console.log(productOfNum);
})();


// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

(() => {
    const divideNum = (num1,num2) => num1 / num2;
    let quotient = divideNum(5,6)
    console.log(quotient);
})();

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

(() => {
    const moduloNum = (num1,num2) => num1 % num2;
    let modulus = moduloNum(5,6)
    console.log(modulus);
})();

// Activity 2: Assignment Operators

// Task 6: Use the + operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console. 

// Task 7: Use the operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.




// Activity 3: Comparison Operators

// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and <= and log the result to the console. 

// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.




// Activity 4: Logical Operators

// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.




// Activity 5: Ternary Operator

// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
